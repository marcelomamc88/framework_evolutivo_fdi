Folders:
- F16_DS1_ALTITUDE: Altitude Manuever changes (Fault Free, Fault 1, Fault 2, Fault 3, and Fault 4) => Entire F16 model
- F16_DS2_W_TS: Angular and Torque on Surface changes (Fault Free, Fault 1, Fault 2, Fault 3, and Fault 4) => Only Actuating System F16 model

Folders Content:
- Hopsan Models
- Matlab Simulink integrated with Hopsan Models through S-Function
- Matlab Scripts simulations
- Generated datasets (.csv)

- data_representation_1: joined ORIGINAL data generated by above scripts
- data_representation_2: data represented (SAMPLE) as CURRENT VALUE concatenated with DIFF BETWEEN CURRENT VALUES AND PREVIOUS ONE.

Steps:
1. Generate dataset through the scripts in the folders (F16_DS1_ALTITUDE, F16_DS2_W_TS, F16_DS3_ALTITUDE, etc)
2. Open the script in the folder DATA_REPRESENTATION_1 and run the script add_features.ipynb
3. To DATA_REPRESENTATION_3, run the script GENERATE_DATA_REPRESENTATION_4.ipynb
4. To DATA_REPRESENTATION_4, run the script GENERATE_DATA_REPRESENTATION_4.ipynb
5. Run the AUTOENCODER.ipynb of the repesctive DATA_REPRESENTATION_X
